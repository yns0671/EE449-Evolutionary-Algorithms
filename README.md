# Evolutionary Art: Image Generation with Triangles

This project implements an evolutionary algorithm to generate an RGB image composed of filled triangles, approximating a source image (`painting.png`). It is developed as part of **METU EE449 Computational Intelligence Homework 3** using Python, with key libraries including OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## ðŸ§  Contents

### Part 1  
Evolutionary algorithm with population initialization, SSIM-based fitness, tournament selection, crossover, and guided/unguided mutation. 

### Part 2  
Experiments with hyperparameters (population size, gene count, tournament size, elites, parents, mutation probability, mutation type).

### Part 3  
Proposed improvements to enhance convergence, with empirical results.
